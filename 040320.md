## Basic syntax

- Know the difference between <i>let, const, var</i><br>`let a = 221, const b = 221;`<br>`let` gives you the privilege to declare variables that are limited in scope <u>to the block</u>, statement of expression unlike `var`.
  `var` is rather a keyword which defines a variable <u>globally regardless of block scope.</u>
- `console.log(a)` is the same as <u>print</u> function.
- Camel case, naming convention.<br>`const daysOfWeek`
- These are two ways to organize a data. Array can include object and vice versa.<br>`const daysOfWeek = ["mon","tue"]`<br>`const tonyInfo = {name:"Tony", age:25, gender:"Male",}`
